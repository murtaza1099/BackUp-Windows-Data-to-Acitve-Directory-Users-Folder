# BackUp-Windows-Data-to-Acitve-Directory-Users-Folder
A lightweight, silent backup tool for Windows 8–11 that automatically copies user data (Documents, Desktop) to mapped network drives like Z:\USERNAME\Backup. Runs hidden, handles errors safely, detects disconnected drives, and requires no Python installation — perfect for automated corporate backups.
``` --- ## ⚙️ Features ✅ **Silent Operation** — runs completely hidden, no console window ✅ **Automatic Folder Detection** — backs up user data only (no apps or system files) ✅ **Error Handling** — gracefully handles missing paths or network issues ✅ **Network-Aware** — detects when `Z:` drive is available before syncing ✅ **Lightweight EXE** — built with PyInstaller; no Python installation needed ✅ **Safe** — doesn’t modify system files or trigger antivirus alerts --- ## 🧩 Folder Structure ``` C:\Users\<Username>\Documents\ C:\Users\<Username>\Desktop\ ``` Backed up to: ``` Z:\Data Drive\<Username>\Backup\ ``` --- ## 🛠️ Build Instructions (Developer) If you want to modify and rebuild the executable: 1. **Install PyInstaller** ```bash pip install pyinstaller ``` 2. **Build Executable** ```bash pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole backupdata.py ``` 3. Your EXE will be located at: ``` dist\backupdata.exe ``` --- ## 🚀 Usage - **Option 1:** Run the `.exe` manually once to verify. - **Option 2:** Schedule it weekly using Windows Task Scheduler: 1. Open **Task Scheduler** 2. Create a **New Task** 3. Set **Trigger:** Weekly (e.g. every Monday 12 PM) 4. Set **Action:** Start Program → `backupdata.exe` 5. Tick **Run whether user is logged on or not** --- ## 🧰 Deployment (for IT/Admins) - Copy `backupdata.exe` to: ``` C:\ProgramData\BackupScript\ ``` - Schedule it via Group Policy or Windows Task Scheduler across all systems. - The script will: - Detect mapped drive `Z:\` - Wait if disconnected - Backup user files to `Z:\USERNAME\Backup\` --- ## 🧾 Example Log A small log file is created in: ``` C:\ProgramData\BackupScript\backup.log ``` It records timestamps, success/failure messages, and skipped files. --- ## 📦 Repository Structure ``` 📁 Universal-Backup-Script/ ├── backupdata.py ├── dist/ │ └── backupdata.exe ├── README.md └── LICENSE ``` --- ## 🧑‍💻 Author **Developed by:** [Murtaza Hasnat](https://github.com/yourusername) 🛡️ *Cybersecurity Enthusiast & Automation Developer* --- ## 🪪 License This project is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). --- ## 🌟 Support If you find this useful, please ⭐ **star this repository** on GitHub! ``` git clone https://github.com/yourusername/universal-backup-script.git ``` --- ### ✅ Summary > A silent, reliable, and network-aware backup utility — ideal for corporate environments where simplicity, automation, and security matter most. ``` --- Would you like me to include a **ready MIT license file** and a sample `.gitignore` (for PyInstaller builds)?
